```
## Overview

The course aims to give students an insight into the object-oriented approach to the design and implementation of software systems. The course also considers specific features of the programming language Java, in particular, graphical interfaces and event driven applications. The second part of the course is intended to give students the necessary background to understand the technical software aspects of how computers communicate across the internet. Students will be introduced to the underlying principles of client-server computing systems and will gain the required conceptual understanding, knowledge and skills to enable them to produce simple web-based computing systems in Java.

## Outline
The following outline is only given as a guide. Topics are presented as needed to complete a practical application. Usually we would choose a game and attempt to implement the game in class learning techniques and concepts along the way.
